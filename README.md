# How it works
Battleknight players copies ranking page and paste into tool. Each time new ranking is pasted, tool calculates changes of so called loot (inner Battleknight currency). Additional button called "Checkpoint!" is used for treating current state as reference one and counting future loot increase based on it.  
Of course same thing can be done using pencil + paper or spreadsheet but web tool is lite, quick and available everywhere.  
Tool in web and Java standalone app is used by players since 2006.
